##The Usual Suspects
Jigsaw puzzles, spot the difference, drag and match, etc., these games are really simple but are the kind of games that you end up doing over and over again, the usual suspects of games.

This is a collection of blueprints, you can download the source code and make your own games. These blueprints or templates are intended as a starting point, they are very rough and the code is not optimized, you should polish and [juice it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg). I hope youÂ´ll find them useful.

Code is license free, but not the artwork. This is a work in progress :)


These templates are based on the [Basic Template](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/tree/master/resources/Project%20Templates).
I have leave the original comments provided by this template :)
